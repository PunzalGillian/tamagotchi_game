# Pokémon Tamagotchi

Welcome to **Pokémon Tamagotchi** — a fun, nostalgic desktop pet game where you hatch and take care of a Pokémon!

In this project, you choose an egg to hatch into a Pokémon (like Charizard, Jigglypuff, or Bulbasaur) and then care for it by checking its status, feeding it, playing with it, and giving it medicine when needed — just like a real tamagotchi!

## ✨ Features

- **Pick an Egg**: Choose from several Pokémon eggs like Bulbasaur, Jigglypuff, Charizard, Squirtle, Ghastly, and Oddish.
- **Hatch and Care**: After picking an egg, it hatches into a Pokémon! You can interact with your Pokémon by:
  - Checking their **Status**
  - Giving **Medicine** if they're sick
  - **Feeding** them
  - **Playing** to keep them happy
- **Sound Effects**: Includes hatching, attention, game start, and death sounds for a more interactive experience.
- **Simple Controls**: Use A, B, and C buttons for navigation and actions.
- **Custom UI**: Styled with a nostalgic pixel art background, tamagotchi shell, and a draggable frameless window.
