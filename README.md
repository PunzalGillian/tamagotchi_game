# Pokémon Tamagotchi

Welcome to **Pokémon Tamagotchi** — a nostalgic desktop pet game where you can hatch and take care of your very own Pokémon, just like the classic Tamagotchi!

In this game, you'll choose an egg to hatch into a Pokémon (such as Charizard, Jigglypuff, or Bulbasaur) and care for it by monitoring its status, feeding it, playing with it, and giving it medicine when needed.

## ✨ Features

  - Checking their **Health**, **Happiness**, **Hunger**, and **Weight**
  - Giving them **Medicine** if they get sick
  - **Feeding** them when they're hungry
  - **Playing** with them to keep them happy
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy immersive sound effects, including hatching, attention, game start, and death sounds.
